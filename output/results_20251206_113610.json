  "transcript": "After Stoffel's severe mauling by the lions, Brian knew that he had to get his badger under control. His solution was a brand new pen and the introduction of hammy to help him work off steam. Far from settling down, though, the canoodling couple soon proved that honey badgers are not just fearless, but astonishingly clever. We started off with a mesh-tie fence, but it didn't work. Stoffel soon devised a plan for opening up the gate, which has got two bolts. He would get the female to go up. She would go up, open the first gate. He'd hold the gate and say, Woman, get up. I'm pulling open. You open up. She goes up to the top, she pulls the second one out. And then he pulls it open. He waits for her to get down and they escape together. The escape was no fluke. Considering their small size, honey badgers have remarkably big brains. The escape was a great success. The intelligence is just beyond anything. Whatever Brian did to keep him in, Stoffel was hell-bent on getting out. In the end, and at great expense, Brian had no choice but to build his own badger alcatraz. I said, Stoffel, the days of your escape are over, buddy. That night they called me, Brian Stoffel's out. I said, it's impossible. But we had trees in here. And he'd climb up the trees and lean over onto the wall and he was out. So he cut all the branches out of the trees in here and left the trees in the middle. Then he dug up the rocks and he'd roll them with his back feet to the wall and he piled them up high enough. And then he'd get out, so he took all the rocks away. This was like a game for Stoffel. Every time I devised some plan, it was like a game for him to work out, how could he get over this? One o'clock in the morning, my wife wakes up, Brian, Brian, and he's in the house. She said, I heard a window break, so we freeze. Oh, my, expecting burglars. And he asked Stoffel at my bedroom door, trying to get to the bedroom door. He made himself a mud ball and he pats it to make it bigger. And he rolled it and he stands up and he just got out like that. People have said, oh, did you train? I said, trained it? Not at all. I'm just following his schemes. Stoffel! I remember one day, a keeper left a rake in Stoffel's enclosure. He scratched himself, lies on his side, there he's thinking, computers working it. Take the rake, put it back, put it against the wall. Climb out and off you go. Stoffel! I mean, you won't believe these stories. You think it's a hoax, it's not a hoax. That is Stoffel.",
  "summary": "Brian Stoffel's badger, Brian, exhibits remarkable intelligence and cleverness through his repeated escapes from high-security enclosures. Despite various measures taken by Brian to prevent these incidents—such as constructing mesh-tie fences around the enclosure area—the badger consistently devises ingenious methods for escape.\n\nFor instance, Brian manages to open gates with the help of his partner or rolls stones up against walls using leverage provided through back feet digging holes in cages and climbing out. Throughout this process, Brian believes he is merely observing Brian's intelligence rather than explicitly training him.\n\n\nChunk Summary:\n\"\"\"- The badger escapes from a high-security enclosure multiple times.\n- Despite various measures taken by the owner to prevent escape (such as removing trees or rocks that could aid climbing), the badger consistently manages to find ways out of his cage, including opening gates with help and rolling stones up against walls using back feet for leverage.
