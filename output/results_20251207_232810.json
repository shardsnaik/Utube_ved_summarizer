  "transcript": "Soldiers would intentionally put mouth guards in their mouths before going into battle. You see, a sharp blast could make the jaw clench reflexively, causing the soldier to bite off their tongue. That's why they started using mouth guards that stabilized their joints, spreading the impact and keeping their tongue safe.",
  "summary": "Soldiers used mouth guards to prevent tongue biting during battle and stabilize joints, spreading impact from sharp blasts."
